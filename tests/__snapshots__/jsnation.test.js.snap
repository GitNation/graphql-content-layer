        "text": "<p>If you own an electronic music instrument made in the last 3 decades, it most likely supports the MIDI protocol. What if I told you that it is possible to interact with your keytar or drum machine directly from your beloved browser? You would go crazy, right? Well, prepare to do so…</p>
<p>With built-in support in Chrome, Firefox and Opera, this possibility is now a reality. This talk will introduce the audience to the Web MIDI API and to my own WEBMIDI.js library so you can get rockin' fast.</p>

This passion only grew as I got older. In college, I became very interested in helping to bridge the growing digital divide and started a student organization, Tech Serv, at Drexel University. After college, I started my career as a data analyst but quickly found a career in Product Management. Here, I was able to combine my love for technology with my passion for improving the lives of others. Since that time, I've been a product manager in a variety of industries including MarTech and HealthTech. Now at Docker, I hope to continue on my journey by improving the lives of developers and helping solve their daily challenges.</p>

Recently, there have been a number of proposals touching on how Modules work, including Import Maps, Top level await, JSON modules, Module asserts, and many others.

We will explore these questions and more, giving you a behind the scenes look at module loading in JS.</p>

<p>In order to get a deep understanding of these new APIs and behaviour changes we will explore the following topics (see table of content).</p>
<p>The workshop is split into several modules. Each of them starts with a 20 min presentation, 30-50 min coding session and is followed by a 10 min retrospective. The final topic about what's coming after React 18 is only covered as a presentation.</p>
<p>By the end of the workshop you will be able to leverage the new features of React 18 and be able to use them in production ready applications.</p>

    "description": "<p>Getting that senior title is easy. Just stick around. Being a true senior takes a new way of thinking.</p>
<p>You're a great engineer. You can code anything you need, solve every problem, google any solution. Your code is flying.</p>
<p>But somehow you're ... stuck. Interviewing feels rough, you pass the coding and fail the real stuff. Culture and system. At work they keep giving you stupid little problems with no growth. You crave challenge and keep tweaking CSS instead. You want some responsibility, damn it! What's that coworker got that you don't? Most of all you crave autonomy. The freedom to tackle big challenges and help the company with your brilliance. They don't even see all the bad code you see! How can they live like this?? Instead of autonomy, you're getting babysat. Managers asking what you're up to, daily standups that feel like a drag, pushback and 'maybe someday' on every idea that you give. I was like that a few years ago. A totally senior engineer who keeps running into walls and getting stuck. Now even bigger companies trust me with designing systems and leading teams on projects that could make or break the company. In this workshop you'll learn what changed and how to apply the Senior Mindset to your work and career:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to gain autonomy</li>
<li>Inspire trust</li>
<li>Own large projects</li>
<li>Get freedom to experiment</li>
<li>Have your ideas heard</li>
<li>Think like an expert</li>
<li>Become a decision-making peer, not a pair of hands</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll work on case studies, analyze anecdotes, discuss insightful books, and look at your work and career in a new light.</p>

development. Or it could be a fire pit of bugs and errors. Either way it will be a learning adventure for us all.
Nuxt 3 has been released just a few months ago, and we cannot wait any longer to explore its new features like its acceptance of Vue 3 and the Nitro Engine. We add a bit of pizzazz to our application with the Sass library Motion UI, because static design is out, and animations are in again.</p>
<p>Our driving power of the stack will be Azure. Azure static web apps are new, close to production and a nifty and quick way for developers to deploy their websites. So of course, we must try this out. </p>
<p>With some sprinkled Azure Functions on top, we will explore what web development in 2022 can do.</p>
