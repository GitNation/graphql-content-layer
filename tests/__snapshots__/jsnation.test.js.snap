We will be building an app that mimics the famous Q&#x26;A website stackoverflow.com. Will start developing from simple front end components, later we'll connect it to a real running backend and then test it and optimise for production.
Attending a workshop is the fastest way to acquire a body of knowledge about building web apps with Svelte.

In this full-day workshop <strong>we will be demystifying GraphQL clients</strong> and will start writing a basic one from scratch. After this workshop you will not only know how modern GraphQL clients work, but how and why they work the way they do – from sending GraphQL queries <strong>to caching their responses</strong>. Over the course of the day we will design and build a client whilst integrating it into an existing UI.</p>
