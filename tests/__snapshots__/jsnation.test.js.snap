    "codeOfConductMain": "<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
<h2>The Long Version</h2>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>
<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>

You usually have some transpilation, at least e.g. Babel. In the future, Web Assembly will enable more innovation in that regards, and existing transpiling languages like Elm, TypeScript, PureScript will continue to improve.

In this talk, I'd go through the Evolution of JavaScript Tooling and frontend build tools, Javascript itself and the future of them all.

Also, Babel and other build tools, what they might most likely be in the future. Also, I'd talk about javascript itself as a language, it's present and it's future.",

In this talk, I'll show you how I perfected my moves by building PoseDance, your friendly TikTok trainer.

Combined with a webcam mapping your own dance skeleton, a bit of math to compare the matching points, Azure functions to authenticate a user, and PlayFab as a game-friendly backend to keep scores and create a leaderboard, you've got the perfect quarantine pastime, making a perfect fool of yourself in front of a webcam.

Have you ever wondered how emoji and complex scripting languages are encoded to work correctly across browsers and devices - for billions of people around the world? Or how new emoji are introduced and approved? Have you ever seen one of these: □ � “special” glyph characters before and want more information on why they might appear and how to avoid them in the future? Let’s talk about Unicode encoding in JavaScript and across the world wide web! We’ll go over best practices, common pitfalls, and provide resources to learn more - even where to go if you want to submit a new emoji proposal! :) </p>

Also, Babel and other build tools, what they might most likely be in the future. Also, I'd talk about javascript itself as a language, it's present and it's future.",

Those kids are popping off while you're sitting around, coding SQL queries. Fortunately, we are technologists, and there's no problem we can't solve, including getting better at TikTok dancing. In this talk, I'll show you how I perfected my moves by building PoseDance, your friendly TikTok trainer.

Combined with a webcam mapping your own dance skeleton, a bit of math to compare the matching points, Azure functions to authenticate a user, and PlayFab as a game-friendly backend to keep scores and create a leaderboard, you've got the perfect quarantine pastime, making a perfect fool of yourself in front of a webcam.

      "description": "<p>In our experience, if you are using promises, you are likely using them wrong (and nearly everybody else is too). This is most often due to misunderstandings about how Promises work, choices that were made by TC39 when designing the promises API, inconsistencies in how Promises are used, or failure to account for the cost of using Promises in an application, and ultimately how the event loop works. In this workshop, we aim to help developers do the right thing with Promises. Through a series of hands on exercises and puzzles, developers will learn the ins and outs of developing with Promises in Node.js, learning everything they should do, and most importantly what they shouldn't do, in order to maximize the effectiveness of their code and avoid common performance pitfalls.</p>

<ul>
<li>choosing a suitable database, </li>
<li>handling the n+1 problem, </li>
<li>using a cache, </li>
<li>security rules. </li>
</ul>
<p>GraphQL has moved the many requests problem from the HTTP layer to the database layer. Instead of many REST calls, we only need to execute one GraphQL request. However, one GraphQL request often results in many database calls, which basically moves the performance problem to the database layer.</p>
<p>FaunaDB is a distributed database that comes out-of-the-box with GraphQL and a flexible security layer. Import your schema, let FaunaDB generate the collections and indexes to support your schema, and you can benefit from a scalable, distributed GraphQL endpoint in 30 seconds. Due to the composable nature and graph-like querying features of the Fauna Query Language (FQL), FaunaDB can offer a GraphQL endpoint that compiles GraphQL queries to FQL one-on-one. No more n+1 problem, no cache needed, and since each GraphQL query translates to one query, you can also take advantage of FaunaDB's strong consistency and flexible security model.</p>

Using this GraphQL DSL, we’ll walk through how to model a Database, authorization rules, relationships, and custom access patterns. We’ll look at how to rapidly prototype an example application, and view some demos including a voting app capable of handling over 100,000 operations per second.",
