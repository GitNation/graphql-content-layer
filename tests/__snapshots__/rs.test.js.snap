    "codeOfConductMain": "<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
<h2>The Long Version</h2>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>
<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>

You register a file, do some work in the worker, you're done! In the real world though, there's a bit more to it.

At Airbnb, we created a service worker system in React that lets us deliver service workers safely and efficiently, measuring the right things, and allowing experimentation and scope-sharing between different types of devices and parts of our site.

Ranging from app shells to precaching to prefetching, I will share with you some of the lessons we have learned from running service worker A/B tests on the most visited page at Airbnb, and what we learned from it!

No matter what size or stage of service worker adoption you are at, I will share ideas and lessons that will help you create a similar system for your project – one that ensures delivering service workers is fast, measurable, painless, and better for your users.",

You register a file, do some work in the worker, you're done! In the real world though, there's a bit more to it.</p>
<p>At Airbnb, we created a service worker system in React that lets us deliver service workers safely and efficiently, measuring the right things, and allowing experimentation and scope-sharing between different types of devices and parts of our site.</p>
<p>Ranging from app shells to precaching to prefetching, I will share with you some of the lessons we have learned from running service worker A/B tests on the most visited page at Airbnb, and what we learned from it!</p>
<p>No matter what size or stage of service worker adoption you are at, I will share ideas and lessons that will help you create a similar system for your project – one that ensures delivering service workers is fast, measurable, painless, and better for your users.</p>

At the end of the talk, I’ll live code an API from scratch in just a couple of minutes and then test out queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

She has spent the majority of her career as a full-stack developer using PHP, Javascript, and CSS, but has a particular fondness for frontend technologies. She is an advocate for both accessibility, and processes that make doing the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard. When she's not exploring solutions, learning new technologies, or reading, Jen's spare time is spent spinning yarn from raw wool and knitting; she's even been known to 3D print her own tools for the job.
She is also fascinated by all things space, antique cars, and IoT.</p>

In this session geared towards devs with prior experience building React applications, let’s answer those questions. We’ll walk through the common bugs that infect our apps and learn how the use of strong types with TypeScript can help prevent them.

Which ones are particular to building React components and applications? Is TypeScript worth the learning curve?</p>
<p>In this session geared towards devs with prior experience building React applications, let’s answer those questions. We’ll walk through the common bugs that infect our apps and learn how the use of strong types with TypeScript can help prevent them. After the session, you’ll be itching to try it out in your next project!</p>

At the end of the talk, I’ll live code an API from scratch in just a couple of minutes and then test out queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

You register a file, do some work in the worker, you're done! In the real world though, there's a bit more to it.

At Airbnb, we created a service worker system in React that lets us deliver service workers safely and efficiently, measuring the right things, and allowing experimentation and scope-sharing between different types of devices and parts of our site.

Ranging from app shells to precaching to prefetching, I will share with you some of the lessons we have learned from running service worker A/B tests on the most visited page at Airbnb, and what we learned from it!

No matter what size or stage of service worker adoption you are at, I will share ideas and lessons that will help you create a similar system for your project – one that ensures delivering service workers is fast, measurable, painless, and better for your users.",

      "description": "<p>The distinction between server state and client state in our applications might be a new concept for some, but it is very important to understand when delivering a top-notch user experience. Server state comes with unique problems that often sneak into our applications by surprise like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing Data across apps</li>
<li>Caching &#x26; Persistence</li>
<li>Deduping Requests</li>
<li>Background Updates</li>
<li>Managing “Stale” Data</li>
<li>Pagination &#x26; Incremental fetching</li>
<li>Memory &#x26; Garbage Collection</li>
<li>Optimistic Updates</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional “Global State” managers pretend these challenges don’t exist and this ultimately results in developers building their own on-the-fly attempts to mitigate them.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will build an application that exposes these issues, allows us to understand them better, and finally turn them from challenges into features by using a library designed for managing server-state called React Query.</p>
<p>By the end of the workshop, you will have a better understanding of server state, client state, syncing asynchronous data (mouthful, I know), and React Query.</p>

      "description": "<p>React is continually improving and evolving. React Hooks are a leap forward in how we develop components and manage state in our React applications. Now you can use state and other React features without having to write a class!</p>
<p>Many React developers have switched from classes to React Hooks and are realizing the benefits of understanding their apps better because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Related logic is now located together;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less code is needed compared to the equivalent class;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Function components better align with React’s mental model;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hooks are just awesome! 🎉</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you have a codebase filled with class components? You could leave it that way, but it will become increasingly more “legacy” as time continues to pass by. Why not change now?</p>
<p>Is your team still not developing with React hooks? The longer you stick with the “old way,” the harder it will be to change when you need to. Why not change now?</p>
<p>In this workshop, not only will you learn the ins and outs of React Hooks, but also how to switch to React Hooks from class lifecycle methods, bringing your codebase and your team into the modern React era. </p>
<p><strong>Get ready to…
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Switch from setState to the <strong>useState</strong> hook;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make API calls with the <strong>useEffect</strong> hook instead of the <strong>componentDidMount</strong>, <strong>componentDidUpdate</strong> &#x26; <strong>componentWillUnmount</strong> lifecycle class methods;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create custom hooks to reuse and compose logic;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use function closures instead of <strong>this</strong> &#x26; <strong>.bind</strong> for callbacks and event handlers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…and many other features to help you write modern React code.</p>

TypeScript proponents proclaim that it eliminates entire classes of bugs that affect our applications. But what exactly are those bugs? Which ones are particular to building React components and applications? Is TypeScript worth the learning curve?

In this session geared towards devs with prior experience building React applications, let’s answer those questions. We’ll walk through the common bugs that infect our apps and learn how the use of strong types with TypeScript can help prevent them.

      "description": "<p>In our experience, if you are using promises, you are likely using them wrong (and nearly everybody else is too). This is most often due to misunderstandings about how Promises work, choices that were made by TC39 when designing the promises API, inconsistencies in how Promises are used, or failure to account for the cost of using Promises in an application, and ultimately how the event loop works. In this workshop, we aim to help developers do the right thing with Promises. Through a series of hands on exercises and puzzles, developers will learn the ins and outs of developing with Promises in Node.js, learning everything they should do, and most importantly what they shouldn't do, in order to maximize the effectiveness of their code and avoid common performance pitfalls.</p>

We will briefly discuss the design philosophy of TypeScript, and then cover all the lesser-known or harder features.
That is: do all the cool and weird meta programming stuff (TS is turing complete!) and learn the tricks you won't find in the handbook.</p>
<p>So join if you feel like you're writing too much type annotations to make TypeScript happy! We'll dive deep into how type inference and control flows works, and how you can make the compiler work for you. We'll discuss all the fancier language constructs like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>ReturnType&#x3C;>, Parameters&#x3C;></li>

In the second half of the workshop, we’ll connect our GraphQL server to a React application with Apollo Client. We’ll break down the modular architecture of the client and teach you how to set everything up and use queries and mutations. We’ll show a few different approaches for working with Apollo: Higher Order Components, Render Props, and hooks.

<p>In this workshop, you'll learn everything you need to diagnose, profile, and fix performance problems in your React application using the Browser Performance Profiler, React DevTools Profiler, and proven React optimization techniques.</p>
<p>The tools we have for profiling React Applications are extremely powerful, but they can often be really difficult to grok. Sure, starting a profiling session is simple enough, but how do you go from all the information in the flamegraph to actionable steps to improve your application's performance? And once you know what parts of your app are causing performance issues, what then? How do you optimize your React components without making the whole application a complex mess?</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget that you should profile your app in production mode to make sure you get accurate measurements. Do you know how to do that?</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Kent C. Dodds and in my latest workshop I'll teach you the ins and outs of optimizing React applications. I will take you on a deep dive browser profiling tools, and show you what you need to know to start using them to make your applications fast right away.</p>

Writing React applications is pretty easy, but shipping those applications with confidence is an entirely different story. How do you know that your changes work? How do you know those changes aren’t going to break other parts of your application? Do you have to manually walk through your whole application to make certain everything’s still working? No thank you! The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. Let’s learn how to write tests that make us confident.</p>
<p>In this hands-on workshop we’ll work on adding tests to existing components as well as use our tests to speed up our workflow building new components. We’ll work with everything from simple components and JavaScript functions to complex components with asynchronous logic.</p>
