    "description": "<p>This workshop will be both a gentle introduction to Machine Learning, and a practical exercise of using the cloud to train simple and not-so-simple machine learning models. We will start with using Automatic ML to train the model to predict survival on Titanic, and then move to more complex machine learning tasks such as hyperparameter optimization and scheduling series of experiments on the compute cluster. Finally, I will show how Azure Machine Learning can be used to generate artificial paintings using Generative Adversarial Networks, and how to train language question-answering model on COVID papers to answer COVID-related questions.</p>

    "description": "<p>Simple chatbots can be built with a number of simple rules, but their UX will be very narrow and limited. Building complex AI assistants, in contrast, requires a lot of effort. To make your users happy, you have to master many things at once: rules, intents, finite state machines, chit-chat tech, dialog flow management, and many other things. It's a job for an entire team. Fortunately, you don't have to hire it. Instead, you can rely upon your trusty software from DeepPavlov.ai. With it, you can offload the complexity of managing the entire infrastructure to DeepPavlov Agent – an open-source Conversational AI orchestrator. Next, you can pick state-of-the-art NLP components from DeepPavlov Library to decode human emotions and understand their intents. Finally, you can pick some of the available skills from DeepPavlov Dream to avoid reinventing the wheel like chit-chat. </p>
<p>In this workshop, you'll be guided through the entire process, from an overview of the platform to building a sample AI assistant that you'll be able to re-use later in your own work. </p>
<p>By the end of this workshop you'll be able to use the provided components from the DeepPavlov family of projects to build  simple AI assistant:</p>
<ul>
<li>work with existing NLP components from DeepPavlov Library like sentiment and emotion classifiers</li>
<li>build simple goal-oriented skill with DeepPavlov Go-Bot</li>
<li>combine them together with the DeepPavlov Agent into a simple AI assistant</li>
<li>augment your simple AI assistant with some of the DeepPavlov Dream pre-built skills</li>

This will be followed by a practice session, where participants will choose one of the real label collection tasks, experiment with selecting settings for the labeling process, and launch their label collection project on one of the largest crowdsourcing marketplaces. The projects will be run on real crowds within the tutorial session. While the crowd performers are annotating the project set up by the attendees, we will present the major theoretical results in efficient aggregation, incremental relabeling, and dynamic pricing. We will also discuss the strengths and weaknesses as well as applicability to real-world tasks, summarizing our five year-long research and industrial expertise in crowdsourcing. Finally, participants will receive a feedback about their projects and practical advice on how to make them more efficient.</p>
