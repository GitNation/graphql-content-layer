        "description": "As an AI scientist and a developer, I have been engaged with AI-applications for many years especially focusing on object detection and recognition purposes. I love thinking that we can get creative in designing neural networks. We can train them supervised, unsupervised, semi or self-supervised, and this gives possibilities to mimic the human brain in a narrow domain. However, in vision applications, there are still things where AI is lacking and will be lacking without computer vision knowledge. Computer vision has been solving detection and recognition problems for many years. However, in the last decade, it seems like AI is seen as a replacement of computer vision. AI can find the optimal model for a specific type of data set and it might achieve generalization better. AI can be designed in a way that it can learn life-long which also brings possibilities of creating models which serve better when they are used longer. However, an AI vision system will be lacking capabilities without computer vision knowledge. First of all, it will require a very big data set to train the model what can be expensive or even not possible. On the other hand, computer vision systems can be modeled only by using a hand-drawn template image. Training AI models also requires GPUs. Nevertheless, I do not want to encourage everyone to train AI models for solving any simple problem which could be solved easily by computer vision. Last but not least, knowing computer vision, machine learning and especially feature engineering methods helps to design hybrid models that might be more robust to adversarial attacks or changing conditions. 

In this lecture, I will briefly introduce how computer vision (especially using the OpenCV library) and machine learning can be used for creating detection and recognition models. Some experience with python, jupyter notebook and some machine learning background would be useful to get more benefits from this lecture.  ",

Therefore, a machine learning toolbox should enable users to understand both data and model, and not burden the practitioner with picking preprocessing steps and hyperparameters.
The dabl library is a first step in this direction. It provides automatic visualization routines and model inspection capabilities while automating away model selection.

dabl contains plot types not available in standard python libraries so far, as well as novel algorithms for picking interesting visualizations.
Heuristics are used to select appropriate preprocessing for machine learning, while state-of-the-art portfolio selection algorithms are used for efficient model and hyperparameter search.

dabl also provides easy access to model evaluation and model inspection tools provided by scikit-learn.",

        "text": "<p>In many real-world applications, data quality and curation and domain knowledge play a much larger role in building successful models than coming up with complex processing techniques and tweaking hyper-parameters.
Therefore, a machine learning toolbox should enable users to understand both data and model, and not burden the practitioner with picking preprocessing steps and hyperparameters.
The dabl library is a first step in this direction. It provides automatic visualization routines and model inspection capabilities while automating away model selection.</p>
<p>dabl contains plot types not available in standard python libraries so far, as well as novel algorithms for picking interesting visualizations.
Heuristics are used to select appropriate preprocessing for machine learning, while state-of-the-art portfolio selection algorithms are used for efficient model and hyperparameter search.</p>
<p>dabl also provides easy access to model evaluation and model inspection tools provided by scikit-learn.</p>
