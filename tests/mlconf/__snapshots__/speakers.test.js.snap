            "description": "As an AI scientist and a developer, I have been engaged with AI-applications for many years especially focusing on object detection and recognition purposes. I love thinking that we can get creative in designing neural networks. We can train them supervised, unsupervised, semi or self-supervised, and this gives possibilities to mimic the human brain in a narrow domain. However, in vision applications, there are still things where AI is lacking and will be lacking without computer vision knowledge. Computer vision has been solving detection and recognition problems for many years. However, in the last decade, it seems like AI is seen as a replacement of computer vision. AI can find the optimal model for a specific type of data set and it might achieve generalization better. AI can be designed in a way that it can learn life-long which also brings possibilities of creating models which serve better when they are used longer. However, an AI vision system will be lacking capabilities without computer vision knowledge. First of all, it will require a very big data set to train the model what can be expensive or even not possible. On the other hand, computer vision systems can be modeled only by using a hand-drawn template image. Training AI models also requires GPUs. Nevertheless, I do not want to encourage everyone to train AI models for solving any simple problem which could be solved easily by computer vision. Last but not least, knowing computer vision, machine learning and especially feature engineering methods helps to design hybrid models that might be more robust to adversarial attacks or changing conditions. 

In this lecture, I will briefly introduce how computer vision (especially using the OpenCV library) and machine learning can be used for creating detection and recognition models.

            "text": "<p>As an AI scientist and a developer, I have been engaged with AI-applications for many years especially focusing on object detection and recognition purposes. I love thinking that we can get creative in designing neural networks. We can train them supervised, unsupervised, semi or self-supervised, and this gives possibilities to mimic the human brain in a narrow domain. However, in vision applications, there are still things where AI is lacking and will be lacking without computer vision knowledge. Computer vision has been solving detection and recognition problems for many years. However, in the last decade, it seems like AI is seen as a replacement of computer vision. AI can find the optimal model for a specific type of data set and it might achieve generalization better. AI can be designed in a way that it can learn life-long which also brings possibilities of creating models which serve better when they are used longer. However, an AI vision system will be lacking capabilities without computer vision knowledge. First of all, it will require a very big data set to train the model what can be expensive or even not possible. On the other hand, computer vision systems can be modeled only by using a hand-drawn template image. Training AI models also requires GPUs. Nevertheless, I do not want to encourage everyone to train AI models for solving any simple problem which could be solved easily by computer vision. Last but not least, knowing computer vision, machine learning and especially feature engineering methods helps to design hybrid models that might be more robust to adversarial attacks or changing conditions. </p>

Get inspired through a whole bunch of creative prototypes that push the boundaries of what is possible in the modern web browser (things have come a long way) and then take your own first steps with machine learning in minutes. By the end of the talk everyone will understand how to recognize an object of their choice which could then be used in any creative way you can imagine. Familiarity with JavaScript is assumed, but no background in machine learning is required. Come take your first steps with TensorFlow.js!</p>

Robots generate massive amounts of sensor and other data; extracting the right information and insights from this requires significant more processing than can be tackled on a single execution environment.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) eliminates the routine steps in the machine learning workflow, thus empowering domain experts without machine learning background to build good initial models, and allowing experienced practitioners to focus additional manual model optimization. This talk describes the extent of automation available for the various steps and demonstrates AutoML with a classifier for human activities based on accelerometer sensor data.",

Automated machine learning (AutoML) eliminates the routine steps in the machine learning workflow, thus empowering domain experts without machine learning background to build good initial models, and allowing experienced practitioners to focus additional manual model optimization. This talk describes the extent of automation available for the various steps and demonstrates AutoML with a classifier for human activities based on accelerometer sensor data.</p>

Automated machine learning (AutoML) eliminates the routine steps in the machine learning workflow, thus empowering domain experts without machine learning background to build good initial models, and allowing experienced practitioners to focus additional manual model optimization. This talk describes the extent of automation available for the various steps and demonstrates AutoML with a classifier for human activities based on accelerometer sensor data.",
